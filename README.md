# Java Curser Starter Project For Maven

I've always had a fascination for ASCII based games, mostly due to the fact that they rely a lot on being actually fun because they don't have fancy graphics and effects to rely on. The issue is that it's hard to manage these kind of projects, especially setting up the scaffolding for an ASCII app / game. The aim of this project is to give you a good starter to your game or app.

The project consists of the main application loop, and two states to show you how it works. Credit isn't mandatory when used but will be greatly appreciated!
